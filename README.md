# Gatsby v2 WordPress Starter

This starter is forked from the
[gatsby-starter-netlify-cms](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms)
and modified to use WordPress instead of netlify-cms, using the [gatsby-source-wordpress](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress) plugin as the data connector.

Demo: https://gatsby-starter-wordpress.netlify.com/
